        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These pecan pie cookies look and taste just like mini pecan pies! Perfect for festive cookie parties where
            you
            want to make something slightly different. You can spice up the cookies by adding cinnamon, ginger, or
            nutmeg to
            the cookie dough.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1</strong>
                <p>To make the filling: Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a saucepan; stir in confectioners' sugar and corn
                    syrup
                    until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often, then stir in pecans
                    until
                    combined. Refrigerate the filling for 30 minutes to chill.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>
                <p>To make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour and baking powder
                    together in a bowl; set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3</strong>
                <p>Beat brown sugar, 3/4 cup butter, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on
                    medium speed until the mixture is creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in flour mixture to form a
                    dough.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 4</strong>
                <p>Pinch off about 1 tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball; press into the bottom of an ungreased
                    cupcake
                    pan cup so it lines the bottom and sides, like a pie crust. Repeat with remaining dough. Fill each
                    crust
                    with about 1 teaspoon of the prepared pecan filling.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 5</strong>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the cookie shells are lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes. Watch
                    closely
                    after 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool in the pans briefly before removing to a wire rack to finish
                    cooling.
                </p>
            </li>

                <strong>Step 6</strong>
                <p>Enjoy!
