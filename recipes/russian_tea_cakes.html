        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These Russian tea cakes are rolled in powdered sugar for a sweet finish and a snowball-like appearance. My
            grandmother "Bubba" brought this Russian tea cake recipe with her when she came from Lithuania, and now my
            family has made it for many generations. I pass it on in the true spirit of the holiday season!
